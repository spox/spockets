== Spockets

Spockets is a simple library for dealing with multiple sockets.
You supply a socket, and one or more blocks to
execute, and Spockets will make sure those blocks get
executed when something comes in over the wire. It's just
that simple.

This library makes use of a thread pool for running user
defined blocks. This setup allows us to use a single thread
for socket monitoring, as well as prevents long running blocks
from delaying everybody else.

=== install (easy):

    gem install actionpool

=== install (less easy):

    git clone http://github.com/spox/actionpool.git
    cd actionpool
    gem build *.gemspec
    gem install ./

=== install (less easy that's a little easier)

{rip}[http://hellorip.com/about.html] makes it easy to install directly from a github repository.

=== Testing

ActionPool is currently tested on:

* Ruby 1.8.6-p383
* Ruby 1.8.7-p248
* Ruby 1.9.1-p376
* JRuby 1.4.0

It has RDocs. They are short, but will be helpful and you
should really consider giving them a look.

Examples are usually helpful, so here we go:

Code:

    require 'socket'
    require 'spockets'
    spockets = Spockets::Spockets.new

    server = TCPServer.new('localhost', 4000)
    socket = TCPSocket.new('localhost', 4000)
    rsocket = server.accept
    output = []
    spockets.add(rsocket){|s|output << s.strip}
    spockets.add(rsocket, 'data'){|s, d| output << "#{d}: #{s.strip}"}
    spockets.on_close(rsocket){|s| output << "closed: #{s}"}
    socket.puts "fubar"
    sleep(0.01)
    socket.close
    sleep(0.01)
    p output

    => ["fubar", "data: fubar", "closed: #<TCPSocket:0xb7637bdc>"]
