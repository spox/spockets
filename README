== Spockets ==

Spockets is a simple library for dealing with multiple sockets.
You supply a socket, and one or more blocks to
execute, and Spockets will make sure those blocks get
executed when something comes in over the wire. It's just
that simple.

There is one requirement for spockets and that is the ActionPool.
This just allows spockets to use a thread pool for executing
blocks so you don't end up having to wait on slow blocks. You
can even provide your own pool for spockets to use, so all the
action can stay in one local pool.

install (easy):

gem install --source gems.github.com spockets

install (less easy):

git clone http://github.com/spox/spockets.git
cd spockets
gem build spockets.gemspec
gem install spockets-x.x.x.gem

It has RDocs. They are where ever your rubygems installed them.
They will probably be helpful to look over.
